Autumn has arrived. Bundle up, bring a few beverages of your own along with any ideas for upcoming maptime events, and join us for twilight/sunset in the Volksgarten.

Since it is the beginning of a new semester for those that study, we hope to see some new faces and provide a place for newer folks to get to know a few people! There will be nametags. ;)

*Bring-your-own-beverages (BYOB) and all are welcome! 3G regulations apply, despite being outdoors.*

**date**: Thursday, 30th September 2021

**time**: 18:00 - 19:30

**place**: The newly installed gravel-covered area with benches in the [Volksgarten, Salzburg](https://osm.org/go/0Id1xh_yA--?m=)
