title: December 2020 - 🏅 Geo Quiz and Stammtisch 🏆
---

The online geo quiz night in November was fun and many said: Let's do that again in December! 11 participants joined for the December quiz with a decent selection of mind-boggling geography / GIS and related questions! ✨ Congratulations to the three winners, who will receive a sticker set and a postcard as a prize!


After the quiz we moved from the traditional video conference to a more playful setting to have an online Stammtisch in the [gather.town](https://gather.town/) beer garden. This was fun!
