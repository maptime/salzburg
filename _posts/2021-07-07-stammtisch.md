title: July 2021 - Stammtisch
---

After a bit of a hiatus, we are back! We will meet with a very informal social gathering now that meeting restrictions have been lifted, allowing us to meet together outside [so long as we stay below 100 people ;) ]  We do ask, however, that even though it is not reqired, that all participants follow the local 3-G guideline, meaning you have tested negative, been vaccinated or recovered from COVID.

*Note: Due to the short notice, we will likely not have any food or drink available onsite, so bring-your-own-beverages (BYOB) and all are welcome!*

**date**: Wednesday, 7th July 2021

**time**: 19:00 - 21:00

**place**: At the pond behind the Natural Science location at the University of Salzburg aka NAWI [Hellbrunnerstra√üe 34, 5020 Salzburg](https://osm.org/go/0Id1ly1rU--?layers=N&m=) ... (Obus #3 or #8, bus stop Faistauergasse)
