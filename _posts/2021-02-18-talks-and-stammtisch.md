We will be having an evening comprised of a few talks and then chatting on February 18, 2021 starting at 20:00!

The talks will include contributions by:

- [Franz Gusenbauer](https://www.igutech.at)
- ... (get in touch if you have a few minutes to share anything you are working on!)

The social meeting afterwards will happen in the Work Adventure environment created for OSM meeting. If you have time to wander around, there is plenty of additional information related to OSM embedded in the virtual space.

We also realise that this event is happening concurrently to an OSGeo codesprint, which, if you are more interested in that, you can find more information here: https://www.osgeo.org/events/joint-ogc-osgeo-asf-code-sprint-2021/
